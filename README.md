# About

This Github organization exists to celebrate SendGrid Prize winners.

If you've won a SendGrid prize at a hackathon, you'll be added as a member of this organization. You may then choose to include this organization publicly on your GitHub profile and display, proudly that _you_ won a SendGrid Prize.

_If you've won a SendGrid prize and are not a member of this organization, please file an issue on this repository, and include the name and date of the event you won the prize at, and we'll add you._

All credit for this idea goes to [J. Randall Hunt](https://github.com/ranman).
