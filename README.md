# About

This Github organization exists to celebrate SendGrid Prize winners. Members may use this organization to display a SendGrid Winner badge on their profile, as such:

<a href="https://github.com/sendgrid-winners/about/raw/master/expanded-example.png" style="display:block;text-align:center;"><img src="https://github.com/sendgrid-winners/about/raw/master/example.png" alt="Organization Example"></a>

If you've won a SendGrid prize at a hackathon, you'll be added as a member of this organization. You may then [choose to include this organization publicly on your GitHub profile](http://webapps.stackexchange.com/a/33973/20955) and display, proudly that _you_ won a SendGrid Prize.

_If you've won a SendGrid prize and are not a member of this organization, please file an issue on this repository, and include the name and date of the event you won the prize at, and we'll add you._

Credit for this idea goes to [J. Randall Hunt](https://github.com/ranman).
